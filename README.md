**Sales Data Analysis**

Project Overview:
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data to uncover key business insights. By using Python for data cleaning and analysis, and Tableau for interactive visualization, the goal is to identify trends, top-performing products, and profitable regions. This analysis can inform business strategies, such as inventory management and targeted marketing campaigns.

Project Goals:
The primary questions answered by this analysis are:
* What was the best month for sales and how much was earned that month?

* Which city had the highest number of sales?

* What products are most often sold together?

* What product was sold the most?

Technologies & Tools:
The project was conducted using the following technologies:

Python: The core language for data manipulation and analysis.

Pandas: Used for data loading, cleaning, and aggregation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for static data visualization within the Jupyter Notebook.

Jupyter Notebook: The primary environment for writing and executing the analysis code.

Tableau Public: Used to create an interactive dashboard for a more in-depth, shareable visualization of the findings.

GitHub: Version control and project portfolio.

Data Source:
The dataset used for this analysis is a Kaggle sales dataset. It contains information on sales orders, products, dates, and locations.

Key Findings:
